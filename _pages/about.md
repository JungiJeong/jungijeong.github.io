I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Purdue University, advised by [Prof. Changhee Jung](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/chjung/).

Before joining Purdue, I have received Ph. D in School of Computing at KAIST under supervision of [Prof. Seungryoul Maeng](http://calab.kaist.ac.kr:8080/~maeng/). But I was also advised and collaborated with [Prof. Jaehyuk Huh](http://calab.kaist.ac.kr:8080/~jhuh/) and [Prof. Youngjin Kwon](https://sites.google.com/view/yjkwon/home) as a member of Computer Architecture and System Lab ([CASYS](http://casys.kaist.ac.kr/)).

Research Interest
-----
My primary area of interest is computer architecture. Throughput my graduate studies, I have explored how computer architecture can support crash consistency and transactions in non-volatile memory. However, my interests are not limited to computer architecture, but span across operating systems and concurrency control. In particular, I am looking for interesting problems in computer-architecture related area and addressing these challenges with HW-SW codesigns.
